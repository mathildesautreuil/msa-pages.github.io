In February 2022, I joined as engineer the [BU Omics](https://www.soladisomics.fr/) of [Soladis Group by Efor](https://www.soladis.com/). Soladis is a group specialized in managing projects around data, and the BU Omics handle the bioinformatics and biostatistics analysis of various field data. I work with [Servier](https://www.servier.fr/), an international pharmaceutic group. I aim to support the quantitative pharmacology department.

Before, I was an Resaearch engineer within Statistique and genome of the [LaMME](http://www.math-evry.cnrs.fr/welcome){:target="\_blank"} at Evry University and the Gnet team of the IPS2 (Plant institute of Paris-Saclay). My research work consists to detect PPR footprints by using machine learning methods at Arabidopsis Thaliana.
Previously, I was a PhD student within the <a href = 'http://biomathematics.mics.centralesupelec.fr/'>Biomathematics</a> team of the [MICS](http://mics.centralesupelec.fr/en/){:target="\_blank"} laboratory at CentraleSupélec (Paris-Saclay University) supervised by Paul-Henry Cournède and Sarah Lemler. My reasearch works focused on the survival analysis and the marker detection in Oncology. I use machine learning and statistical methods to predict the survival duration and detect the biomarkers in high-dimension.
                                        
I did an two-year's apprenticeship at both [LMRS](http://lmrs.univ-rouen.fr/){:target="\_blank"} (Laboratoire Mathématiques Raphaël Salem) and [LITIS](https://www.litislab.fr/accueil){:target="\_blank"} (Laboratoire d'Infomratique et traitement de l'information et des systèmes). My principle work was to develop mixture models bivariate Negative Binomiale for RNA-seq data. In addition, I developed an R package for the simulation and estimation of Markov and Semi-Markov models and a Shiny application for the processing of qRT-PCR data called [PROqPCR](https://qpcrapp.shinyapps.io/proqpcr/){:target="\_blank"}
